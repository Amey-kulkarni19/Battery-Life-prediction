# Battery-Life-prediction

The project Predicting Battery Degradation Using Linear Regression Contains
4 files

1. main.py - Contains main class where all the necessary files are imported
2. data_extraction.py - Contains logic to load data from .mat files
3. Linear_regression.py - Contains Linear Regression logic along with some other helping classes
4. plots.py - Contains all the codes which is used to plot the data

Dependancies -

1. Make sure you have all 4 .py files along with B0005.mat, B0006.mat, B0007.mat, B0018.mat
in the same directory.

2. Files B0005.mat, B0006.mat, B0007.mat, B0018.mat contain the data
which will be used in our program execution.

3. Make sure you have the following libraries installed in your laptop
   (A) numpy
   (B) scipy
   (C) matplotlib

4. You only need to execute the main.py file. The output will have some plots.
    If you're using VS code, make sure you have your plot display settings configured.
